    run. You look around to take a head count of your squad-mates. Where\u2019s Miller?
    He\u2019s probably just a little bit you. You ask your squad-mate how far you
    should go; he says that the injured solider is losing blood quickly and needs
    emergency care.\n\r\n1) Find a somewhat secluded space to patch up the injured
    solider.\r\n2) Keep running and risk him dying.\r\n"
